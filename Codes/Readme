This code package includes two files.

The first file, Cache_Class_Method_for_DataLookupTable.txt, contains the cache class method. Copy and paste its contents into your class.

The second file, DataLookup_Cache_CSP_WebApp_Code.txt, contains the CSP web page code. Copy all its contents and paste them into your cache CSP page.

Then, update your CSP page according to the instructions provided in the README file (README.md). Finally, compile both files and use them.
